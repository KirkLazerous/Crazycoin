Crazycoin (CYC)

This coin has lost it, got totally nuts due to all the other coins getting released and with the weekend getting nearly it just had
to release itself.

Only mine this coin if you are crazy yourself otherwise things will not make sense.

1+1=3 - This could be right, if everyone else was wrong.

Is the glass half empty or half full? The glass is always full, a certain proportion of water and air.

Wouldn't it be crazy if this coin got onto every major exchange?

It would be crazy not too, yeah?
